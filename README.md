## Requirements

* [zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola)


## Usage

1. Posts go to: `content/posts/`
1. Presentations go to: `content/presentation/`

Home page uses `paginate_by` from  `content/_index.md` to paginate both posts and presentations. This requires setting `transparent = true` for both subsections.
