## Installation

I've just learned about [Fedora Silverblue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org). It's website doesn't really do a great job at explaining what this project really is. A quote from Fedora Magazine helps a bit:

> Silverblue is a codename for the new generation of the desktop operating system, previously known as Atomic Workstation. The operating system is delivered in images that are created by utilizing the [rpm-ostree](https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/) project. The main benefits of the system are speed, security, atomic updates and immutability. 

The installation was super easy. I just downloaded the ISO file and attached it to my VM. There is a graphical installer that has only a few steps. Disk encryption worked without a hiccup.


## Configuration

With Silverblue you can install tools globally with Flatpak or with `rpm-ostree`. 

### Flathub

Set up Flathub by going to [flatpack/Fedora](https://flatpak.org/setup/Fedora/) and clicking on a "Flathub repository file" button. Now you should be able to find applications from Flathub using "Software" application.

### rpm-ostree

[rpm-ostree](https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/administrator-handbook/) is used to update the system but also to install overlay packages globally.

```sh
$ rpm-ostree install golang neovim emacs fish
```

The changes will be applied **only after a system reboot**. Luckily, there seems to be an exprimental way to apply [the changes immediately](https://techoverflow.net/2021/05/15/how-to-apply-fedora-coreos-changes-without-a-reboot/):

```sh
$ sudo rpm-ostree ex apply-live
```

> I used [packages](https://packages.fedoraproject.org/) for the search. Maybe there is a better way ðŸ¤”.

### Toolbox

[Toolbx](https://containertoolbx.org/) is a container which could be used for exprimentation and installing packages without affecting the system.

```sh
# Start a container
$ toolbox

# Inside toolbox you can use dnf to install packages
$ dnf install java-11-openjdk
```

> All packages that you install inside toolbox are not available to the system globally.

```sh
# List local toolboxes
$ toobox list
```

### Modules

By default dnf and rpm-ostree install the latest version of the package. In some cases I want to install an older version of the package. It is possible by using [modules](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/modularity/installing-modules/).

```sh
$ toolbox

# List available modules
$ dnf module list

# Install the module
$ sudo dnf module install nodejs:14/default

$ node --version
v14.18.2
$ npm --version
6.14.15
```

rpm-ostree has [an experimental way](https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/administrator-handbook/#modularity) to install modules globally. Unfortunately, it didn't work for me.

```sh
$ rpm-ostree ex module enable nodejs:14
```


## Misc

I couldn't get Peek to work but luckily there is a [Kooha](https://github.com/SeaDve/Kooha) for screen recording that just works!

You can change default shell with:

```sh
$ sudo usermod --shell /path/to/shell <user>
```

This website helps with finding the right packages for developer tools: [https://developer.fedoraproject.org/tech.html](https://developer.fedoraproject.org/tech.html)

I probably don't need to install all those tools globally. I should try scoping them with the toolbx.
